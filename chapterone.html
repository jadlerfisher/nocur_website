                “Roger, Roger. What’s our vector, Victor?”<p></p>
                — Captain Oveur (Airplane)
            </h3>
            <p>
                This book is all about looking at the world around us and coming up with clever ways to simulate that
                world with code. Divided into three parts, the book will start by looking at basic physics—how an apple
                falls from a tree, a pendulum swings in the air, the earth revolves around the sun, etc. Absolutely
                everything contained within the first five chapters of this book requires the use of the most basic
                building block for programming motion—the vector. And so this is where we begin our story.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, the word vector can mean a lot of different things. Vector is the name of a New Wave rock band
                formed in Sacramento, CA in the early 1980s. It’s the name of a breakfast cereal manufactured by
                Kellogg’s Canada. In the field of epidemiology, a vector is used to describe an organism that transmits
                infection from one host to another. In the C# programming language, a vector is an
                implementation of a dynamically resizable array data structure. While all these definitions are
                interesting, they’re not what we’re looking for. What we want is called a Euclidean vector (named for
                the Greek mathematician Euclid and also known as a geometric vector). When you see the term “vector” in
                this book, you can assume it refers to a Euclidean vector, defined as an entity that has both magnitude
                and direction.
            </p>
            <p>
                A vector is typically drawn as a arrow; the direction is indicated by where the arrow is pointing, and
                the magnitude by the length of the arrow itself.
            </p>

                In the above illustration, the vector is drawn as an arrow from point A to point B and serves as an
                instruction for how to travel from A to B.

                1.1 Vectors, You Complete Me

            </h2>
            <p>
                Before we dive into more of the details about vectors, let’s look at a basic Unity example that
                demonstrates why we should care about vectors in the first place. If you’ve read any introductory
                C# textbooks or taken a class on programming with Unity (and hopefully you’ve done one of
                these things to help prepare you for this book), you probably, at one point or another, learned how to
                write a simple bouncing mover scene.

            </p>

            </ul>

            <p>
                In the above example, we have a very simple world—a blank canvas with a circular shape (a “mover”)
                traveling around. This mover has some properties, which are represented in the code as variables.
            </p>
            <div class="note">
                <p>
                <p>
                    Location -
                    x and y
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    Speed -
                    xSpeed and ySpeed
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                In a more advanced scene, we could imagine having many more variables:
            </p>
            <div class="note">
                <p>
                <p>
                    Acceleration -
                    xAcceleration and yAcceleration
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    Target location -
                    xTarget and yTarget
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    Wind -
                    xWind and yWind
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    Friction -
                    xFriction and yFriction
                </p>
                <p></p>
            </div>
            <p>
                It’s becoming clearer that for every concept in this world (wind, location, acceleration, etc.), we’ll
                need two variables. And this is only a two-dimensional world. In a 3D world, we’ll need x, y, z, xSpeed,
                ySpeed, zSpeed, and so on.

                Wouldn’t it be nice if we could simplify our code and use fewer variables?

                Instead of:
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    private float x;
    private float y;

    private float xSpeed = .03f;
    private float ySpeed = .03f;
    </pre>

            <p>
                We could simply have…
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    Vector2 location;
    Vector2 speed;
    </pre>

            <p>
                Taking this first step in using vectors won’t allow us to do anything new. Just adding vectors
                won’t magically make your Unity experiences simulate physics. However, they will simplify your
                code and provide a set of functions for common mathematical operations that happen over and over
                and over again while programming motion.

                    1.2 Vectors for Unity Programmers

                </h2>
            <p>
                One way to think of a vector is the difference between two points. Consider how you might go
                about providing instructions to walk from one point to another.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some vectors and possible translations:

                    <li>
                        (3, 4) - Walk three steps east; turn and walk five steps north.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (2, -1) - Walk two steps east; turn and walk one step south.

            <p>
                You’ve probably done this before when programming motion. For every frame of animation (i.e. a
                single cycle through Unity’s Update() loop), you instruct each object on the screen to move a
                certain number of units horizontally and a certain number of units vertically.
            </p>
            <div id="ImageContainer">

                <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter01/ch01_03.png" style="  width: 100%;

                For every frame:

            <p>
                <b>new location + velocity applied to current location</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                If velocity is a vector (the difference between two points), what is location? Is it a vector
                too? Technically, one might argue that location is not a vector, since it’s not describing how
                to move from one point to another—it’s simply describing a singular point in space.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nevertheless, another way to describe a location is the path taken from the origin to reach that
                location. Hence, a location can be the vector representing the difference between location and
                origin.

                Let’s examine the underlying data for both location and velocity. In the bouncing mover example,
                we had the following:

            <div class="note">

                    location - x, y

                velocity - xSpeed, ySpeed

            <p>
                Notice how we are storing the same data for two floating point numbers, an x and y. If we
                were to write a vector class ourselves, we’d start with something rather basic:

            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    public class Vector2
    {
        public float x;
        public float y;

        public Vector2(float x_, float y_)
        {
            x = x_;
            y = y_;
        }
    }
    </pre>

            <p>
                At its core, a Vector2 is just a convenient way to
                store two values.

            </p>
            <p>
                And so this …
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    private float x;
    private float y;

    private float xSpeed = .03f;
    private float ySpeed = .03f;
    </pre>

            <p>
                becomes …

            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    private Vector2 location = new Vector2(0f, 0f);
    private Vector2 velocity = new Vector2(0.3f, 0.3f);
    </pre>

            <p>
                Now that we have two vector objects (location and velocity), we’re ready to implement
                the algorithm for motion—location += velocity. In Example 1.1, without
                vectors, we had:
            </p>


            <pre class="prettyprint">

    x += xSpeed;
    y += ySpeed;
    </pre>

            <p>
                In Unity, we could rewrite the above as:

            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    location += velocity;
    </pre>

            <p>
                However, let's look deeper at the math of how we add two different Vector
                objects.

            </p>
            <h2>
                1.3 Vector Addition
            </h2>
            <p>
                Before we continue looking at the Vector2 class and its addVectors() method  (purely for
                the sake of learning since it’s already implemented for us in Unity
                itself as an  operator of Vector2), let’s examine vector addition using the notation found in math and
                physics textbooks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vectors are typically written either in boldface type or with an arrow on top.
                For the purposes of this book, to distinguish a vector from a scalar (scalar
                refers to a single value, such as an integer or a floating point number), we’ll
                use an arrow on the right or on top for notation:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vector: u→</li>
                <li>Scalar: x</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let’s say I have the following two vectors: </p>
            <div id="ImageContainer">

                <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadlerfisher/nocur_website/master/images/ch01_05.png" style="  width: 100%;
    height: 100%;" alt="Figure 1.5: ">

            </div>
            <br />
            <p>
                Each vector has two components, an x and a y. To add two vectors together, we
                simply add both x’s and both y’s.


            </p>
            <div id="ImageContainer">

                <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadlerfisher/nocur_website/master/images/ch01_06.png" style="  width: 100%;
    height: 100%;" alt="Figure 1.6: ">

            </div>
            <br>

            <p>In other words: </p>
            <p>w→=u→+v→</p>
            <p>can be written as: </p>
            <p>w.x=u.x+v.x</p>
            <p>
                Then, replacing u and v with their values from Figure 1.6, we get:

            </p>
            <p>w.x=5+3</p>
            <p>w.y=-2+-4</p>
            <p>which means that: </p>
            <p>w.x=8 w.y=-6</p>
            <p>Finally, we write that as a vector:</p>
            <p>w→=(8,-6)</p>
            <p>
                Now that we understand how to add two vectors together, we can look at how
                addition is implemented in the Vector2 class itself. Let’s write a function
                called AddVectors() that takes another Vector2 object as its argument.

            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    Vector2 AddVectors(Vector2 vectorA, Vector2 vectorB)
    {
        float newX = vectorA.x + vectorB.x;
        float newY = vectorA.y + vectorB.y;
        return new Vector2(newX, newY);
    }
    </pre>

            <p>
                Now that we see how AddVectors() is written inside of Vector2, we can return to our
                bouncing mover example with its location + velocity algorithm and implement
                vector addition
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    location = AddVectors(location, velocity);

    //While this is perfectly acceptable, in Unity,
    //we will write this with built in vector arithmetic so everything plays nice.

    location += velocity;
    </pre>

            <p>
                And here we are, ready to rewrite the bouncing mover example using
                Vector2.

                Now, you might feel somewhat disappointed. After all, this may
                initially appear to have made the code more complicated than the
                original version. While this is a perfectly reasonable and valid
                critique, it’s important to understand that we haven’t fully
                realized the power of programming with vectors just yet. Looking at
                a simple bouncing mover and only implementing vector addition is just
                the first step. As we move forward into a more complex world of
                multiple objects and multiple forces (which we will introduce in
                Chapter 2), the benefits of Vector2 will become more apparent.
            </p>
            <p>
                We should, however, note an important aspect of the above transition
                to programming with vectors. Even though we are using Vector2
                objects to describe two values—the x and y of location and the
                x and y of velocity—we still often need to refer to the x, y (and z for Vector 3)
                components of each Vector2 individually. This is done through standard OOP dot notation,
                ie location.x or velocity.y.

            <h4>Vector multiplication</h4>
            <p>
                Moving on to multiplication, we have to think a little bit
                differently. When we talk about multiplying a vector, what
                we typically mean is scaling a vector. If we wanted to scale
                a vector to twice its size or one-third of its size (leaving
                its direction the same), we would say: “Multiply the vector
                by 2” or “Multiply the vector by 1/3.” Note that we are
                multiplying a vector by a scalar, a single number, not
                another vector.
            </p>
            <p>
                To scale a vector, we multiply each component (x and y) by a
                scalar.

            <p>
                Multiplication and division, as we just saw,
                are means by which the length of the vector
                can be changed without affecting direction.
                Perhaps you’re wondering: “OK, so how do I
                know what the length of a vector is? I know
                the components (x and y), but how long
                (in units) is the actual arrow?”
                Understanding how to calculate the length
                (also known as magnitude) of a vector is
                incredibly useful and important.

                Notice in the above diagram how the vector,
                drawn as an arrow and two components (x and
                y), creates a right triangle. The sides are
                the components and the hypotenuse is the
                arrow itself. We’re very lucky to have this
                right triangle, because once upon a time, a
                Greek mathematician named Pythagoras
                developed a lovely formula to describe the
                relationship between the sides and
                hypotenuse of a right triangle.

            <h2>1.6 Normalizing Vectors</h2>
            <p>
                Calculating the magnitude of a vector
                is only the beginning. The magnitude
                function opens the door to many
                possibilities, the first of which is
                normalization. Normalizing refers to
                the process of making something
                “standard” or, well, “normal.” In
                the case of vectors, let’s assume
                for the moment that a standard
                vector has a length of 1. To
                normalize a vector, therefore, is to
                take a vector of any length and,
                keeping it pointing in the same
                direction, change its length to 1,
                turning it into what is called a
                unit vector.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since it describes a vector’s
                direction without regard to its
                length, it’s useful to have the unit
                vector readily accessible. We’ll see
                this come in handy once we start to
                work with forces in Chapter 2.

                In other words, to normalize a
                vector, simply divide each component
                by its magnitude. This is pretty
                intuitive. Say a vector is of length
                5. Well, 5 divided by 5 is 1. So,
                looking at our right triangle, we
                then need to scale the hypotenuse
                down by dividing by 5. In that
                process the sides shrink, divided by
                5 as well.

            <h2>1.7 Vector Motion: Velocity</h2>
            <p>
                All this vector math stuff sounds
                like something we should know
                about, but why? How will it
                actually help us write code? The
                truth of the matter is that we
                need to have some patience. It
                will take some time before the
                benefits of using the Vector2
                class fully come to light. This
                is actually a common occurrence
                when first learning a new data
                structure. For example, when you
                first learn about an array, it
                might seem like much more work
                to use an array than to just
                have several variables stand for
                multiple things. But that plan
                quickly breaks down when you
                need a hundred, or a thousand,
                or ten thousand things. The same
                can be true for Vector2. What
                might seem like more work now
                will pay off later, and pay off
                quite nicely. And you don’t have
                to wait too long, your reward
                will come in the next chapter.

            </p>
            <p>
                For now, however, we want to
                focus on simplicity. What does
                it mean to program motion using
                vectors? We’ve seen the
                beginning of this in Example
                1.2: the bouncing mover. An
                object on screen has a location
                (where it is at any given
                moment) as well as a velocity
                (instructions for how it should
                move from one moment to the
                next). Velocity is added to
                location:
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    location += velocity * Time.deltaTime;
    </pre>
            <p>
                Wait, do you notice that new bit of code? Time.deltaTime?
            </p>
            <p>Time.deltaTime allows us to get the completion time in seconds since the last frame. Using this property allows us to move a GameObject in a direction at a certain number of units per second.</p>

            <p>
                And then we draw the object
                at that location:
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    mover.transform.position = new Vector2(location.x, location.y);
    </pre>

            <p>This is Motion 101.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Add velocity to
                    location
                </li>
                <li>
                    Send object to
                    location
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In the bouncing mover
                example, all of this
                code happened in a
                single script. What we
                want to do now is move
                towards encapsulating
                all of the logic for
                motion inside of a
                class. This way, we can
                create a foundation for
                programming moving
                objects in Unity.
                In section I.2 of the
                introduction, “The
                Random Walker Class,” we
                briefly reviewed the
                basics of
                object-oriented-programming
                (“OOP”). Beyond that
                short introduction, this
                book assumes experience
                with objects and classes
                in Unity.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this case, we’re going
                to create a generic
                Mover class that
                will describe a thing
                moving around the
                screen. And so we must
                consider the following
                two questions:

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    What data does a
                    mover have?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What functionality
                    does a mover have?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Our Motion 101 algorithm
                tells us the answers to
                these questions. A
                Mover object has
                two pieces of data:
                location and velocity,
                which are both Vector2
                objects.
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    public class Mover
    {
        // The basic properties of a mover class
        private Vector2 location, velocity;

        // Gives the class a GameObject to draw on the screen
        private GameObject mover = GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Sphere);
    }
    </pre>

            <p>
                Its functionality is
                just about as
                simple. The Mover
                needs to move and it
                needs to be seen.
                We’ll implement
                these needs as
                functions named
                Step(). We’ll put
                all of our motion
                logic code in
                Step().

            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    public void Step()
    {
        // Moves the mover // Time.deltaTime is the time passed since the last frame.
        location += velocity * Time.deltaTime;
        

        // Updates the GameObject of this movement
        mover.transform.position = new Vector2(location.x, location.y);
    }
    </pre>
            <p>
                We’ve forgotten one crucial
                item, however:
                the object’s
                constructor. The
                constructor is a
                special function
                inside of a
                class that
                creates the
                instance of the
                object itself.
                It is where you
                give
                instructions on
                how to set up
                the object. It
                always has the
                same name as the
                class and is
                called by
                invoking the new
                operator:
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    public Mover()
    {
        // Our method for setting the window bounds found below
        FindWindowLimits();

        location = new Vector2(Random.Range(-maximumPos.x, maximumPos.x), Random.Range(-maximumPos.y, maximumPos.y));
        velocity = new Vector2(Random.Range(-2f, 2f), Random.Range(-2f, 2f));

        // We need to create a new material for WebGL
        Renderer r = mover.GetComponent&lt;Renderer>();
        r.material = new Material(Shader.Find("Diffuse"));
    }
    </pre>

            <p>
                In our case, let’s
                arbitrarily decide
                to initialize our
                Mover object by
                giving it a random
                location and a
                random velocity.

            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    location = new Vector2(Random.Range(-maximumPos.x, maximumPos.x), Random.Range(-maximumPos.y, maximumPos.y));

    velocity = new Vector2(Random.Range(-2f, 2f), Random.Range(-2f, 2f));
    </pre>

            <p>
                If
                object-oriented
                programming is
                at all new to
                you, one aspect
                here may seem a
                bit confusing.
                After all, we
                spent the
                beginning of
                this chapter
                discussing the
                Vector2 class.
                The Vector2
                class is the
                template for
                making the
                location object
                and the velocity
                object. So what
                are they doing
                inside of yet
                another object,
                the Mover
                object? In fact,
                this is just
                about the most
                normal thing
                ever. An object
                is simply
                something that
                holds data (and
                functionality).
                That data can be
                numbers
                (integers,
                floats, etc.) or
                other objects!
                We’ll see this
                over and over
                again in this
                book. For
                example, in
                Chapter 4 we’ll
                use a class to
                describe a
                system of
                particles. That
                ParticleSystem
                object will have
                as its data a
                list of Particle
                objects…and each
                Particle object
                will have as its
                data several
                Vector2 objects!
            </p>
            <p>
                Let’s finish off
                the Little Mover
                class by
                incorporating a
                function to
                determine what
                the object
                should do when
                it reaches the
                edge of the
                window. For now
                let’s do
                something
                simple, and just
                have it wrap
                around the
                edges.

            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    public void CheckEdges()

                (1)
                what
                a
                Vector2
                is
                and
                (2)
                how
                we
                use
                Vector2s
                inside
                of
                an
                object
                to
                keep
                track
                of
                its
                location
                and
                movement.
                This
                is
                an
                excellent
                first
                step

                one
                more,
                somewhat
                bigger
                step
                forward.
                After

                The
                strict
                definition
                of
                acceleration
                we’re
                using
                here
                is:
                the
                rate
                of
                change
                of
                velocity.
                Let’s
                think
                about
                that
                definition
                for
                a
                moment.
                Is
                this
                a
                new
                concept?
                Not
                really.
                Velocity
                is
                defined
                as
                the
                rate
                of
                change
                of
                location.
                In
                essence,
                we
                are
                developing
                a
                “trickle-down”
                effect.
                Acceleration
                affects
                velocity,
                which
                in
                turn
                affects
                location
                (for
                some
                brief
                foreshadowing,
                this
                point
                will
                become
                even
                more
                crucial

                affect
                acceleration,
                which
                affects
                velocity,
                which
                affects
                location).

                every

                In
                other
                words,
                our
                goal
                now

                programming
                motion
                is:
                Come
                up
                with
                an
                algorithm
                for
                how
                we
                calculate
                acceleration
                and
                let
                the
                trickle-down

                work
                its
                magic.
                (In
                truth,
                you’ll
                find

                is
                at
                rest.
                We
                don’t
                have
                to

                Speaking

                So
                let’s
                pick
                a

                Maybe
                you’re

                “Gosh,
                those

                seem
                awfully
                small!”
                That’s
                right,
                they
                are
                quite
                tiny.
                It’s
                important
                to
                realize

                in
                the

                about
                thirty

                per
                second
                depending
                on
                our
                scene’s
                frame
                rate.
                And
                so
                to
                keep
                the
                magnitude
                of

                Because the random vector is a
                normalized one, we can try
                scaling it:


            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    // Random acceleration but it's not normalized
    acceleration = new Vector2(Random.Range(-1f, 1f), Random.Range(-1f, 1f));

    // Normalize the acceletation
    acceleration.Normalize();

    // Now we can scale the magnitude as we wish
    acceleration *= Random.Range(5f, 10f);
    </pre>
            <p>
                While this may seem like an
                obvious point, it’s crucial to
                understand that acceleration
                does not merely refer to the
                speeding up or slowing down of a
                moving object, but rather any
                change in velocity in either
                magnitude or direction.
                Acceleration is used to steer an
                object, and we’ll see this again
                and again in future chapters as
                we begin to program objects that
                make decisions about how to move
                about the screen.

                1.9 Static vs. Non-Static
                Functions

            </h2>
            <p>
                Before we get to Algorithm #3
                (accelerate towards the mouse),
                we need to cover one more rather
                important aspect of working with
                vectors and the Vector2 class:
                the difference between using
                static methods and non-static
                methods.
            <p></p>
            Forgetting about vectors for a
            moment, take a look at the
            following code:

            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    float x = 0;
    float y = 5;

    x = x + y;
    </pre>
            <p>
                Pretty simple, right? x has the
                value of 0, we add y to it, and
                now x is equal to 5. We could
                write the corresponding code
                pretty easily based on what
                we’ve learned about Vector2.

            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    Vector2 v = new Vector2(0,0);
    Vector2 u = new Vector2(4,5);
    </pre>
            <p>
                The vector v has the value of
                (0,0), we add u to it, and now v
                is equal to (4,5). Easy, right?
            <p></p>
            Let’s take a look at another
            example of some simple floating
            point math:
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    float x = 0;
    float y = 5;

    float z = x + y;
    </pre>
            <p>
                x has the value of 0, we add y
                to it, and store the result in a
                new variable z. The value of x
                does not change in this example
                (neither does y)! This may seem
                like a trivial point, and one
                that is quite intuitive when it
                comes to mathematical operations
                with floats. However, it’s not
                so obvious with mathematical
                operations in Vector2. Let’s try
                to write the code based on what
                we know so far.

            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    Vector2 v = new Vector2(0,0);
    Vector2 u = new Vector2(4,5);
    <s>Vector2 w = AddVectors(v, u);</s>
    </pre>
            <p>
                The above might seem like a good
                guess, but it’s just not the way
                the Vector2 class works. If we
                look at one definition of
                AddVectors() . . .

            </p>

            <pre class="prettyprint">

    void AddVectors(Vector2 vectorA, Vector2 vectorB)
    {
        float newX = vectorA.x + vectorB.x;
        float newY = vectorA.y + vectorB.y;
    }
    </pre>
            <p>
                we see that this code does not
                accomplish our goal. First, it
                does not return a new Vector2
                (the return type is “void”) and
                second, it changes the value of
                the Vector2 upon which it is
                called. In order to add two
                Vector2 objects together and
                return the result as a new
                Vector2, we must use the static
                AddVectors() function. Here is an example
                of the AddVectors() method returning a new
                Vector2.
            <p></p>

            <p>
                Functions that we call from the
                class name itself (rather than
                from a speciﬁc object instance)
                are known as static functions.
                Here are two examples of
                function calls that assume two
                Vector2 objects, v and u:
            </p>


            <pre class="prettyprint">

    AddVectors(v,u);
    //Not static: called from an object instance.
    v.Add(u);
    </pre>
            <p>
                You might not have
                encountered static methods before.
                Vector2's static functions allow
                us to perform generic
                mathematical operations on
                Vector2 objects without having
                to adjust the value of one of
                the input Vector2s. Let’s look
                at how we might write the static
                version of Distance(Vector2 a, Vector2 b). It returns the distance between two vectors.

            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    public static float Distance(Vector2 a, Vector2 b);
    </pre>

            <p>
                There are several differences
                here:

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The function is labeled as
                    static.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The function does not have a
                    void return type, but rather
                    returns a Vector2.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The function creates a new
                    Vector2 (v3) and returns the
                    sum of the components of v1
                    and v2 in that new Vector2.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When you call a static function,
                instead of referencing an actual
                object instance, you simply
                reference the name of the class
                itself.

            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    static Vector2 addVectors(Vector2 vectorA, Vector2 vectorB)

                vector based on a rule or a
                formula, we need to compute two
                things: magnitude and direction.
                Let’s start with direction. We
                know the acceleration vector
                should point from the object’s
                location towards the mouse
                location. Let’s say the object
                is located at the point (x,y)
                and the mouse at
                (mouseX,mouseY).

            </p>
            <div id="ImageContainer">

                <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter01/ch01_15.png" style="  width: 50%;"
                     alt="Figure 1.15: ">

                <p>Figure 1.15 </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Let’s rewrite the above using
                Vector2 syntax. Assuming we are
                in the Mover class and thus have
                access to the object’s Vector2
                position, we then have:

            </p>
            <ul>
                <b>
                <li>dx = mouseX - x </li>
                <li>dy = mouseY - y </li>
                </li>
                </b>
            </ul>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    Vector2 mousePos = Input.mousePosition;
    </pre>
            <p>
                We now have a Vector2 that
                points from the mover’s location
                all the way to the mouse. If the
                object were to actually
                accelerate using that vector, it
                would appear instantaneously at
                the mouse location. This does
                not make for good animation, of
                course, and what we want to do
                now is decide how quickly that
                object should accelerate toward
                the mouse.
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    mover.SubtractVectors(mousePos, mover.location);
    </pre>

            <p>
                To summarize, we take the
                following steps:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Calculate a vector that
                    points from the object to
                    the target location (mouse)

                </li>
                <li>
                    Normalize that vector
                    (reducing its length to 1)

                </li>
                <li>
                    Scale that vector to an
                    appropriate value (by
                    multiplying it by some
                    value)

                </li>
                <li>
                    Assign that vector to
                    acceleration

                </li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                And here are those steps in the
                update() function itself:

                You may be wondering why the
                circle doesn’t stop when it
                reaches the target. It’s
                important to note that the
                object moving has no knowledge
                about trying to stop at a
                destination; it only knows where
                the destination is and tries to
                go there as quickly as possible.
                Going as quickly as possible
                means it will inevitably
                overshoot the location and have
                to turn around, again going as
                quickly as possible towards the
                destination, overshooting it
                again, and so on and so forth.
                Stay tuned; in later chapters
                we’ll learn how to program an
                object to arrive at a location
                (slow down on approach).


            </p>
            <p>
                This example is remarkably close
                to the concept of gravitational
                attraction (in which the object
                is attracted to the mouse
                location). Gravitational
                attraction will be covered in
                more detail in the next chapter.
                However, one thing missing here
                is that the strength of gravity
                (magnitude of acceleration) is
                inversely proportional to
                distance. This means that the
                closer the object is to the
                mouse, the faster it
                accelerates.

                <p>
                </p>
                Develop
                a
                set
                of
                rules
                for
                simulating
                the
                real-world
                behavior
                of
                a
                creature,
                such
                as
                a
                nervous
                fly,
                swimming
                fish,
                hopping
                bunny,
                slithering
                snake,
                etc.
                Can
                you
                control
                the
                object’s
                motion
                by
                only
                manipulating
                theƒ
                acceleration?
                Try
                to
                give
                the
                creature
                a
                personality
                through
                its
                behavior
                (rather
                than
                through
                its
                visual
                design).
