                Introduction
            </h2>
            <h3>
                “I am two with nature.” <p></p>
                — Woody Allen
            </h3>
            <p>
                Here we are: the beginning. Well, almost the beginning. If it’s been a while since you’ve done any
                programming in Unity (or any math, for that matter), this introduction will get your mind back into
                computational thinking before we approach some of the more difficult and complex material.
            </p>
            <p>
                When working with Unity, it is important to note that all the scripts we will be using inherit from the
                built in Unity MonoBehaviour class. More advanced tutorials can describe in detail the importance of this
                distinction but for our purposes the important thing to remember is that MonoBehaviour scripts must be
                attached to a game object. If you plan on following along with these examples, you must attach your
                script to an empty game object within your project hierarchy.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Chapter 1, we’re going to talk about the concept of a vector and how it will serve as the building
                block for simulating motion throughout this book. But before we take that step, let’s think about what
                it means for something to simply move around the screen. Let’s begin with one of the best-known and
                simplest simulations of motion—the random walk.

            </p>
            <p>
                A vector is typically drawn as a arrow; the direction is indicated by where the arrow is pointing, and
                the magnitude by the length of the arrow itself.
            </p>

                I.1 Random Walks
            </h2>
            <p>
                Imagine you are standing in the middle of a balance beam. Every ten seconds, you flip a coin. Heads, take
                a step forward. Tails, take a step backward. This is a random walk—a path defined as a series of random
                steps. Stepping off that balance beam and onto the floor, you could perform a random walk in two
                dimensions by flipping that same coin twice with the following results:

                Yes, this may seem like a particularly unsophisticated algorithm. Nevertheless, random walks can be used
                to model phenomena that occur in the real world, from the movements of molecules in a gas to the
                behavior of a gambler spending a day at the casino. As for us, we begin this book studying a random walk
                with three goals in mind.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We need to review a programming concept central to this book—object-oriented programming. The random
                    Mover will serve as a template for how we will use object-oriented design to make things that move
                    around a Unity space.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The random walk instigates the two questions that we will ask over and over again throughout this
                    book: “How do we define the rules that govern the behavior of our objects?” and then, “How do we
                    implement these rules in Unity?”
                </li>
                <li>
                    Throughout the book, we’ll periodically need a basic understanding of randomness, probability, and
                    Perlin noise. The random walk will allow us to demonstrate a few key points that will come in handy
                    later.
                </li>

            <h2>
                I.2 The Random Mover Class
            </h2>
            <p>
                Let’s review a bit of object-oriented programming (OOP) first by building a Mover object. This will be
                only a cursory review. If you have never worked with OOP before, you may want something more
                comprehensive; I’d suggest stopping here and reviewing the basics of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDAYS-qYe6Y">Unity</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                An object in Unity is an entity that has both data and functionality. We are looking to design a Mover
                object that both keeps track of its data (where it exists on the screen) and has the capability to
                perform certain actions (such as draw itself or take a step).


            </p>
            <p>
                A class is the template for building actual instances of objects. Think of a class as the cookie cutter;
                the objects are the cookies themselves.

            </p>
            <p>
                Let’s begin by defining the Mover class—what it means to be a Mover object. The mover only needs two
                pieces of data—a number for its x-location and one for its y-location.  In this example we will use a
                Vector3, a struct that represents the x, y and z location of an object. Vectors will be covered next
                chapter, for now just know that we can pull the x location and y location from our Vector3 using
                standard OOP dot notation.

            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    public class IntroMover
    {
        // The basic properties of a mover class
        private float x-location;
        private float y-location;
        private Vector3 location;

        // Gives the class a GameObject to draw on the screen
        private GameObject mover = GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Sphere);

        // The window limits
        private Vector2 maximumPos;
    }
    </pre>

            <p>
                Every class must have a constructor, a special function that is called when the object is first created.
                You can think of it as the object’s start(). There, we’ll initialize the Mover’s starting location (in
                this case, the center of the window).
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    public IntroMover()
    {
        FindWindowLimits();
        x-location = 0f;
        y-location = 0f;
        // Set location to Vector2.zero, shorthand for (0, 0)
        location = Vector2.zero;
        // We need to create a new material for WebGL
        Renderer r = mover.GetComponent&lt;Renderer>();
        r.material = new Material(Shader.Find("Diffuse"));
    }
    </pre>

            <p>
                Finally, in addition to data, classes can be defined with functionality. In this example, a Mover has
                three functions. We first write a function that allows the object to take a step. Now, this is where things get a bit more
                interesting. Remember that floor on which we were taking random steps? Well, now we can use a Unity
                window in that same capacity. There are four possible steps. A step to the right can be simulated by
                incrementing x (x++); to the left by decrementing x (x--); forward by going down a pixel (y++); and
                backward by going up a pixel (y++). How do we pick from these four choices? Earlier we stated that we
                could flip two coins. In Unity, however, when we want to randomly choose from a list of options, we
                can pick a random number using Random.Range(value1, value2). Next, we take the appropriate step
                (left, right, up, or down) depending on which random number was picked.
            </p>

            <pre class="prettyprint">

    public void step()
    {
        location = mover.transform.position;
        // Each frame choose a new Random number 0,1,2,3,
        // If the number is equal to one of those values, take a step
        int choice = Random.Range(0, 4);
        if (choice == 0)
        {
            location.x++;

        }
        else if (choice == 1)
        {
            location.x--;
        }
        else if (choice == 2)
        {
            location.y++;
        }
        else if (choice == 3)
        {
            location.y--;
        }

        mover.transform.position += location * Time.deltaTime;
    }
    </pre>
            <p>The two other methods: CheckEdges() and findWindowLimits() find the edge of the screen and check to see if the Mover is near the edge. If so, the move restarts at its origin. Remember, the origin is stored as x-location and y-location or (0,0). We can store these positions in a data type called a Vector2. Vector2.zero if the same as writing x-location = 0f and y-location = 0f.</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    public void CheckEdges()
    {
        location = mover.transform.position;
        // Reset location to zero upon reaching maximum or(||) negative maximum(minimum)
        if (location.x > maximumPos.x || location.x < -maximumPos.x)
        {
            location = Vector2.zero;
        }
        if (location.y > maximumPos.y || location.y < -maximumPos.y)
        {
            location = Vector2.zero;
        }
        // Set the position of the mover to location
        mover.transform.position = location;
    }

    private void FindWindowLimits()
    {
        // We want to start by setting the camera's projection to Orthographic mode
        Camera.main.orthographic = true;
        // Ensure the camera is positioned in the center of the scene
        Camera.main.transform.position = Vector2.zero;
        // Next we grab the maximum position for the screen
        maximumPos = Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(new Vector2(Screen.width, Screen.height));
        // The maximum position can be attributed to the minimum bounds by setting it negative
        // maximumPos and -maximumPos equate to maximum and minimum screen bounds
    }
    </pre>


            <p>
                Now that we’ve written the class, it’s time to make an actual Mover object in the main part of our
                start() and update(). Assuming we are looking to model a single random walk, we declare one global
                variable of type Mover.
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    using UnityEngine;

    public class IntroductionFig1 : MonoBehaviour
    {
        // We need to create a mover instance
        IntroMover mover;

        // Start is called before the first frame update
        void Start()
        {
            mover = new IntroMover();
        }

    }
    </pre>
            <p>Finally, during each cycle through FixedUpdate(), we ask the Mover to take a step and check edges.</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    // Update is called once per frame
    void FixedUpdate()
    {
        // Have the walker choose a direction
        mover.Step();
        mover.CheckEdges();

                There are a couple improvements we could make to the random Mover. For one, this Mover’s step choices
                are limited to four options—up, down, left, and right. But any given pixel in the window has eight
                possible neighbors, and a ninth possibility is to stay in the same place.

                To implement a Mover object that can step to any neighboring pixel (or stay put), we could pick a number
                between 0 and 8 (nine possible choices). However, a more efficient way to write the code would be to
                simply pick from three possible steps along the x-axis (-1, 0, or 1) and three possible steps along the
                y-axis.

                Taking this further, we could use floating point numbers (i.e. decimal numbers) for x and y instead and

            <p>
                All of these variations on the “traditional” random walk have one thing in common: at any moment in time,
                the probability that the Mover will take a step in a given direction is equal to the probability that
                the Mover will take a step in any direction. In other words, if there are four possible steps, there is
                a 1 in 4 (or 25%) chance the Mover will take any given step. With nine possible steps, it’s a 1 in 9
                (or 11.1%) chance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Conveniently, this is how the Random.Range(value 1, value2) function works. Unity's random number
                generator (which operates behind the scenes) produces what is known as a “uniform” distribution of
                numbers. We can test this distribution with a Unity function that counts each time a random number is
                picked and graphs it as the height of a rectangle.

                graph differs in height. Our sample size (i.e. the number of random numbers we’ve picked) is rather
                small and there are some occasional discrepancies, where certain numbers are picked more often. Over
                time, with a good random number generator, this would even out.

                I.3 Probability and Non-Uniform Distributions
            </h2>
            <p>
                Remember when you first started programming in Unity? Perhaps you wanted to draw a lot of circles on the
                screen. So you said to yourself: “Oh, I know. I’ll draw all these circles at random locations, with
                random sizes and random colors.” In a computer graphics system, it’s often easiest to seed a system with
                randomness. In this book, however, we’re looking to build systems modeled on what we see in nature.
                Defaulting to randomness is not a particularly thoughtful solution to a design problem—in particular,
                the kind of problem that involves creating an organic or natural-looking simulation.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a few tricks, we can change the way we use Random.Range() to produce “non-uniform” distributions of
                random numbers. This will come in handy throughout the book as we look at a number of different
                scenarios. When we examine genetic algorithms, for example, we’ll need a methodology for performing
                “selection”—which members of our population should be selected to pass their DNA to the next generation?
                Remember the concept of survival of the fittest? Let’s say we have a population of monkeys evolving. Not
                every monkey will have a equal chance of reproducing. To simulate Darwinian evolution, we can’t simply
                pick two random monkeys to be parents. We need the more “fit” ones to be more likely to be chosen. We
                need to define the “probability of the fittest.” For example, a particularly fast and strong monkey
                might have a 90% chance of procreating, while a weaker one has only a 10% chance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let’s pause here and take a look at probability’s basic principles. First we’ll examine single event
                probability, i.e. the likelihood that a given event will occur.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have a system with a certain number of possible outcomes, the probability of the occurrence of a
                given event equals the number of outcomes that qualify as that event divided by the total number of all
                possible outcomes. A coin toss is a simple example—it has only two possible outcomes, heads or tails.
                There is only one way to flip heads. The probability that the coin will turn up heads, therefore, is one
                divided by two: 1/2 or 50%.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take a deck of fifty-two cards. The probability of drawing an ace from that deck is:
            </p>
            <p><b>number of aces / number of cards = 4 / 52 = 0.077 = ~ 8% </b></p>
            <p>
                The probability of drawing a diamond is:
            </p>
            <p><b>number of diamonds / number of cards = 13 / 52 = 0.25 = 25% </b></p>
            <p>
                We can also calculate the probability of multiple events occurring in sequence. To do this, we simply
                multiply the individual probabilities of each event.
            </p>
            <p>
                The probability of a coin turning up heads three times in a row is:
            </p>
            <p><b>(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8 (or 0.125) </b></p>
            <p>
                …meaning that a coin will turn up heads three times in a row one out of eight times (each “time” being
                three tosses).
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a couple of ways in which we can use the Random.Range() function with probability in code. One
                technique is to fill an array with a selection of numbers—some of which are repeated—then choose random
                numbers from that array and generate events based on those choices.

            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    int[] numbers = new[] { 1, 1, 2, 3, 3 };
    int randomInt = Random.Range(0, numbers.Length);
    Debug.Log(numbers[randomInt]);
    </pre>

            <p>
                Running this code will produce a 40% chance of printing the value 1, a 20% chance of printing 2, and a
                40% chance of printing 3.

            </p>
            <p>
                We can also ask for a random number (let’s make it simple and just consider random floating point values
                between 0 and 1) and allow an event to occur only if our random number is within a certain range. For
                example:

            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    float prob = 0.10f;
    float r = Random.Range(0f, 1f);
    if (r < prob) {

        Debug.Log("Try Again!");

    }
    </pre>

            <p>
                This method can also be applied to multiple outcomes. Let’s say that Outcome A has a 60% chance of
                happening, Outcome B, a 10% chance, and Outcome C, a 30% chance. We implement this in code by picking a
                random float and seeing into what range it falls.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>between 0.00 and 0.60 (60%) –> Outcome A</li>
                <li>between 0.60 and 0.70 (10%) –> Outcome B</li>
                <li>between 0.70 and 1.00 (30%) –> Outcome C</li>
            </ul>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    float num = Random.Range(0f, 1f);

    if (num < 0.6f)
    {
        Debug.Log("Outcome A!");
    }
    else if (num > 0.6f && num < 0.7f)
    {

                We could use the above methodology to create a random Mover that tends to move to the right. Here is an
                example of a Mover with the following probabilities:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>chance of moving up: 20%</li>

                <li>chance of moving left: 20%</li>
                <li>chance of moving right: 40%</li>

            <h2>I.4 A Normal Distribution of Random Numbers</h2>
            <p>
                Let’s go back to that population of simulated Unity monkeys. Your program generates a thousand Monkey
                objects, each with a height value between 2 and 3 (as this is a world of monkeys that have heights
                between 2 and 3 meters (the units of Unity)).
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    float h = Random.Range(2f,3f);
    </pre>

            <p>
                Does this accurately depict the heights of real-world beings? Think of a crowded sidewalk in New York
                City. Pick any person off the street and it may appear that their height is random. Nevertheless, it’s
                not the kind of random that Random.Range() produces. People’s heights are not uniformly distributed;
                there are a great deal more people of average height than there are very tall or very short ones. To
                simulate nature, we may want it to be more likely that our monkeys are of average height (2.5 meters),
                yet still allow them to be, on occasion, very short or very tall.
            </p>
            <p>
                A distribution of values that cluster around an average (referred to as the “mean”) is known as a
                “normal” distribution. It is also called the Gaussian distribution (named for mathematician Carl
                Friedrich Gauss) or, if you are French, the Laplacian distribution (named for Pierre-Simon Laplace).
                Both mathematicians were working concurrently in the early nineteenth century on defining such a
                distribution.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you graph the distribution, you get something that looks like the following, informally known as a
                bell curve:

            <p>Figure I.1 and I.2: </p>

            <p>
                The curve is generated by a mathematical function that defines the probability of any given value
                occurring as a function of the mean (often written as μ, the Greek letter mu) and standard deviation (σ,
                the Greek letter sigma).

            </p>
            <p>
                The mean is pretty easy to understand. In the case of our height values between 2 and 3, you probably
                have an intuitive sense of the mean (i.e. average) as 2.5. However, what if I were to say that the
                standard deviation is 3 or 15? What does this mean for the numbers? The graphs above should give us a
                hint. The graph on the left shows us the distribution with a very low standard deviation, where the
                majority of the values cluster closely around the mean. The graph on the right shows us a higher
                standard deviation, where the values are more evenly spread out from the average.

            </p>
            <p>
                The numbers work out as follows: Given a population, 68% of the members of that population will have
                values in the range of one standard deviation from the mean, 98% within two standard deviations, and
                99.7% within three standard deviations. Given a standard deviation of 5 pixels, only 0.3% of the monkey
                heights will be less than 235 pixels (three standard deviations below the mean of 250) or greater than
                265 pixels (three standard deviations above the mean of 250).

                    Consider a class of ten students who receive the following scores (out of 100) on a test:

                <p>
                    The standard deviation is calculated as the square root of the average of the squares of deviations
                    around the mean. In other words, take the difference from the mean for each person and square it
                    (variance). Calculate the average of all these values and take the square root as the standard
                    deviation.

                Luckily for us, to use a normal distribution of random numbers in Unity, we don’t have to do any of these
                calculations ourselves. Instead, we can make use of a class known as Random.Range, which we get for free
                as part of the default C# libraries imported into Unity.

            </p>

            <p>
                If we want to produce a random number with a normal (or Gaussian) distribution each time we run through
                update(), it’s as easy as using Random.Range() within Random.Range().
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    // To create a Gaussian distribution in Unity we can actually use Random.Range() within two separate Random.Ranges
    float num = Random.Range(Random.Range(-10f, 10f), Random.Range(-10f, 10f));
    </pre>

            <p>
                Here’s the thing. What are we supposed to do with this value? What if we wanted to use it, for example,
                to assign the x-position of a shape we draw on screen?


            </p>
            <p>
                We can call a method in our FixedUpdate loop to return a normal distribution of random numbers with the following
                parameters: a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Let’s say we want a mean of 320 (the center
                horizontal pixel in a window of width 640) and a standard deviation of 60 pixels. We can adjust the
                value to our parameters by multiplying it by the standard deviation and adding the mean.

                    A Gaussian random walk is defined as one in which the step size (how far the object moves in a given

            <h2>I.5 A Custom Distribution of Random Numbers</h2>
            <p>
                There will come a time in your life when you do not want a uniform distribution of random values, or a
                Gaussian one. Let’s imagine for a moment that you are a random Mover in search of food. Moving randomly
                around a space seems like a reasonable strategy for finding something to eat. After all, you don’t know
                where the food is, so you might as well search randomly until you find it. The problem, as you may have
                noticed, is that random Movers return to previously visited locations many times (this is known as
                “oversampling”). One strategy to avoid such a problem is to, every so often, take a very large step.
                This allows the Mover to forage randomly around a specific location while periodically jumping very far
                away to reduce the amount of oversampling. This variation on the random walk (known as a Lévy flight)
                requires a custom set of probabilities. Though not an exact implementation of a Lévy flight, we could
                state the probability distribution as follows: the longer the step, the less likely it is to be picked;
                the shorter the step, the more likely.
            </p>
            <p>
                Earlier in this prologue, we saw that we could generate custom probability distributions by filling an
                array with values (some duplicated so that they would be picked more frequently) or by testing the
                result of random(). We could implement a Lévy flight by saying that there is a 1% chance of the Mover
                taking a large step.
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    // Random.value Returns a random number between 0.0 [inclusive] and 1.0 [inclusive]
    float r = Random.value
    if (r < 0.01) 
    {
        xstep = Random.Range(-100f,100f);
        ystep = Random.Range(-100f,100f);

    {
        xstep = Random.Range(-1F,1f);
        ystep = Random.Range(-1f,1f);
    }

            <p>
                However, this reduces the probabilities to a fixed number of options. What if we wanted to make a more
                general rule—the higher a number, the more likely it is to be picked? 3.145 would be more likely to be
                picked than 3.144, even if that likelihood is just a tiny bit greater. In other words, if x is the
                random number, we could map the likelihood on the y-axis with y = x.

                If we can figure out how to generate a distribution of random numbers according to the above graph, then
                we will be able to apply the same methodology to any curve for which we have a formula.
            </p>
            <p>
                One solution is to pick two random numbers instead of one. The first random number is just that, a random
                number. The second one, however, is what we’ll call a “qualifying random value.” It will tell us whether
                to use the first one or throw it away and pick another one. Numbers that have an easier time qualifying
                will be picked more often, and numbers that rarely qualify will be picked infrequently. Here are the
                steps (for now, let’s consider only random values between 0 and 1):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pick a random number: R1</li>
                <li>Compute a probability P that R1 should qualify. Let’s try: P = R1.</li>
                <li>Pick another random number: R2 </li>
                <li>If R2 is less than P, then we have found our number—R1!</li>
                <li>If R2 is not less than P, go back to step 1 and start over.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Here we are saying that the likelihood that a random value will qualify is equal to the random number
                itself. Let’s say we pick 0.1 for R1. This means that R1 will have a 10% chance of qualifying. If we
                pick 0.83 for R1 then it will have a 83% chance of qualifying. The higher the number, the greater the
                likelihood that we will actually use it.

            <h2>I.6 Perlin Noise (A Smoother Approach)</h2>
            <p>
                A good random number generator produces numbers that have no relationship and show no discernible
                pattern. As we are beginning to see, a little bit of randomness can be a good thing when programming
                organic, lifelike behaviors. However, randomness as the single guiding principle is not necessarily
                natural. An algorithm known as “Perlin noise,” named for its inventor Ken Perlin, takes this concept
                into account. Perlin developed the noise function while working on the original Tron movie in the early
                1980s; it was designed to create procedural textures for computer-generated effects. In 1997 Perlin won
                an Academy Award in technical achievement for this work. Perlin noise can be used to generate various
                effects with natural qualities, such as clouds, landscapes, and patterned textures like marble.
            </p>
            <p>
                Perlin noise has a more organic appearance because it produces a naturally ordered (“smooth”) sequence of
                pseudo-random numbers. The graph on the left below shows Perlin noise over time, with the x-axis
                representing time; note the smoothness of the curve. The graph on the right shows pure random numbers
                over time. (The code for generating these graphs is available in the accompanying book downloads.)

            <p>
                Unity (?) has a built-in implementation of the Perlin noise algorithm: the static function Mathf.PerlinNoise
                (x float, y float). The Mathf.PerlinNoise(x,y)
                two arguments as noise is computed two dimensions in Unity.
                Let’s start by looking at one-dimensional noise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consider drawing a circle in our Unity window at a random x-location.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, instead of a random x-location, we want a Perlin noise x-location that is “smoother.” You might
                think that all you need to do is replace Random.Range(value 1, value2) with Mathf.PerlinNoise(x,y).

            </p>

            <p>
                While conceptually this is exactly what we want to do—calculate an x-value that ranges between 0 and the
                width according to Perlin noise—this is not the correct implementation. While the arguments to the
                Random.Range(value1, value2) function specify a range of values between a minimum and a maximum,  Mathf.PerlinNoise(x,y) does not work this
                way. Instead, the output range is fixed—it always returns a value between 0 and 1.

            </p>
            <p>
                We can think of one-dimensional Perlin noise as a linear sequence of values over time. For example:

            <p>
                Now, in order to access a particular noise value in Unity, we have to pass a specific "moment in time" to
                the  Mathf.PerlinNoise(x,y) function. For example:
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    // "Bobbing" animation from 1D Perlin noise.

    // Range over which height varies.
    float heightScale = 1.0f;

    // Distance covered per second along X axis of Perlin plane.
    float xScale = 1.0f;

    void Update()
    {
        float height = heightScale * Mathf.PerlinNoise(Time.time * xScale, 0.0f);
        Vector3 pos = transform.position;
        pos.y = height;
        transform.position = pos;
    }
    </pre>
            <p>Note, that in this instance, heightScale and widthScale are referring to the distance covered per second. Our Time.time property handles the time between the frames.</p>
            <br></br>

            <br></br>
            <h4>Mapping Noise</h4>
            <p>
                Now we’re ready to answer the question of what to do with the noise value. Once we have the value
                with a range between 0 and 1, it’s up to us to map that range to what we want. The easiest way to do
                this is with a custom for Unity, Remap() function. The Remap() function takes five arguments. First up is the
                value we want to map, in this case value. Then we have to give it the value’s current range (minimum and
                maximum), followed by our desired range.

            </p>

            <pre class="prettyprint">

    public static float Remap(this float value, float from1, float to1, float from2, float to2)
    {
        return (value - from1) / (to1 - from1) * (to2 - from2) + from2;

    }
    </pre>

            <div id="ImageContainer">

            </div>
            <p>
                In this case, we know that noise has a range between 0 and 1, but we’d like to draw our circle with a
                range between 0 and the window’s width.
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    // The widthScale will be the length of the screen
    float widthScale = Screen.width;

    // Distance covered per second along X axis of Perlin plane.
    float xScale = 1.0f;

    void Update()
    {
        float width = widthScale * Mathf.PerlinNoise(Time.time * xScale, 0.0f);

        Vector3 pos = transform.position;
        pos.x  = width;
        transform.position = pos;
    }
    </pre>
            <p>
                We can apply the exact same logic to our random Mover, and assign both its x- and y-values according
                to Perlin noise.

            <p>
                Notice how the above example requires an additional pair of variables: xScale and yScale. This is because we
                need to keep track of two time variables, one for the x-location of the Mover object and one for
                the y-location. But there is something a bit odd about these variables. Why does xScale start at 1f and
                yScale at .5f? While these numbers are arbitrary choices, we have very specifically initialized our
                two time variables with different values. This is because the noise function is deterministic: it
                gives you the same result for a specific time t each and every time. If we asked for the noise value
                at the same time t for both x and y, then x and y would always be equal, meaning that the Mover
                object would only move along a diagonal. Instead, we simply use two different parts of the noise
                space, starting at 1f for x and .5f for y so that x and y can appear to act independently of each
                other.

                In truth, there is no actual concept of time at play here. It’s a useful metaphor to help us
                understand how the noise function works, but really what we have is space, rather than time. The
                graph above depicts a linear sequence of noise values in a one-dimensional space, and we can ask for
                a value at a specific x-location whenever we want. In examples, you will often see a variable named
                xoff to indicate the x-offset along the noise graph, rather than t for time (as noted in the
                diagram).

                    In the above random Mover, the result of the noise function is mapped directly to the Mover’s
                    location. Create a random Mover where you instead map the result of the Mathf.PerlinNoise(x,y) function to a

            <h4>Two-Dimensional Noise</h4>
            <p>
                This idea of noise values living in a one-dimensional space is important because it leads us right
                into a discussion of two-dimensional space. Let’s think about this for a moment. With
                one-dimensional noise, we have a sequence of values in which any given value is similar to its
                neighbor. Because the value is in one dimension, it only has two neighbors: a value that comes
                before it (to the left on the graph) and one that comes after it (to the right).

            <p>
                Two-dimensional noise works exactly the same way conceptually. The difference of course is that we
                aren’t looking at values along a linear path, but values that are sitting on a grid. Think of a
                piece of graph paper with numbers written into each cell. A given value will be similar to all of
                its neighbors: above, below, to the right, to the left, and along any diagonal.

            </p>
            <P>
                If you were to visualize this graph paper with each value mapped to the brightness of a color, you
                would get something that looks like clouds. White sits next to light gray, which sits next to gray,
                which sits next to dark gray, which sits next to black, which sits next to dark gray, etc.

                This is why noise was originally invented. You tweak the parameters a bit or play with color to make
                the resulting image look more like marble or wood or any other organic texture.

            </p>
            <p>
                Let’s take a quick look at how to implement two-dimensional noise in Unity. If you wanted to color
                every pixel of a window randomly, you would need a nested loop, one that accessed each pixel and
                picked a random brightness.

            </p>
            This is a nice start conceptually—it gives you a noise value for every (x,y) location in our
            two-dimensional space. The problem is that this won’t have the cloudy quality we want. Jumping from
            pixel 200 to pixel 201 is too large of a jump through noise. Remember, when we worked with
            one-dimensional noise, we incremented our time variable by 0.01 each frame, not by 1! A pretty good
            solution to this problem is to just use different variables for the noise arguments. For example, we
            could increment a variable called xoff each time we move horizontally, and a yoff variable each time
            we move vertically through the nested loops. Below is some code from Unity on how to generate 2D Perlin noise.

                We’ve examined several traditional uses of Perlin noise in this section. With one-dimensional noise,
                we used smooth values to assign the location of an object to give the appearance of wandering. With
                two-dimensional noise, we created a cloudy pattern with smoothed values on a plane of pixels. It’s
                important to remember, however, that Perlin noise values are just that—values. They aren’t
                inherently tied to pixel locations or color. Any example in this book that has a variable could be
                controlled via Perlin noise. When we model a wind force, its strength could be controlled by Perlin
                noise. Same goes for the angles between the branches in a fractal tree pattern, or the speed and
                direction of objects moving along a grid in a flow field simulation.

            <h2>I.7 Onward</h2>
            <p>
                We began this chapter by talking about how randomness can be a crutch. In many ways, it’s the most
                obvious answer to the kinds of questions we ask continuously—how should this object move? What color
                should it be? This obvious answer, however, can also be a lazy one.

            </p>
            <p>
                As we finish off the introduction, it’s also worth noting that we could just as easily fall into the
                trap of using Perlin noise as a crutch. How should this object move? Perlin noise! What color should
                it be? Perlin noise! How fast should it grow? Perlin noise!

            </p>
            <p>
                The point of all of this is not to say that you should or shouldn’t use randomness. Or that you
                should or shouldn’t use Perlin noise. The point is that the rules of your system are defined by you,
                and the larger your toolbox, the more choices you’ll have as you implement those rules. The goal of
                this book is to fill your toolbox. If all you know is random, then your design thinking is limited.
                Sure, Perlin noise helps, but you’ll need more. A lot more.

            </p>
            <p>
                I think we’re ready to begin.
